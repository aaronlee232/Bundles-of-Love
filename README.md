# Bundles-of-Love
Prototype for the Bundles of Love Charity Website

I focused on the UI design in this project, as I wanted to see if I could make something that looks similar to the websites templates provided by Website Builders

## Website Link
https://aaronlee232.github.io/Bundles-of-Love/html/index.html#

## Tools Used
Adobe XD

Visual Studio Code

## Languages Used
- HTML

- CSS

- SASS

## Notes
I learned a lot about negative space and color coordination from this project.

I was able to achieve a good understanding of how to use Adobe XD to both plan out the layout of a website, and also create simple vector art for a website

## Improvements
On the product side, the functionality of the website can definetly be improved. 

For example, I could add Javascript animations for page transitions and custom scrolling.

On the code side, I could add more documentation and add more structure to the code for better readability.
